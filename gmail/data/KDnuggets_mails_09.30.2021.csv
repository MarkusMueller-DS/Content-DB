Business leaders are asked to make massively impactful decisions based upon top-line dashboard data. Insight-fed visualizations are indeed helpful, but they're not the reliable, rich understanding of data required to run a successful business.


What you need is transaction-level intelligence about the data populating all of your dashboards - and the ability to explore, query and analyze it whenever needed, in real-time.

* Three reasons why dashboards alone restrict the informed decision making they purport to enable
* How real success hinges upon drilling down into data without losing its fidelity or security
* How to move beyond select, aggregated data queries and enable transaction-level insight and unrestricted data exploration

All types of enterprises invest in data lakes as a cost-effective, centralized repository to support a wide range of analytics use cases including operational dashboards, data science, machine learning and even big data processing. Amazon Web Services (AWS) powers many of today's cloud data lakes, making them more scalable and simpler to deploy and manage-and making the data they house easy to manage and analyze.

Despite these advantages, some AWS users still experience challenges related to data lake performance, data workflows and data access. But there are ways to overcome them.

Read this eBook to learn:
bullet   The top five best practices to help data lake architects realize an optimal data architecture

bullet   How to accelerate queries of data stored in an AWS data lake while reducing data engineering costs

bullet   How to simplify data access for analysts and data scientists

The urgency to compete on analytics is driving digital transformation projects across industries. Many enterprises are revamping ERP systems and moving their analytics to the cloud to achieve greater speed and scalability. However, most are still using the same cumbersome data transformation processes. As a result, business users are left scrambling to manually integrate data across multiple siloed repositories. What's more, businesses are unable to leverage innovation in application development.


From data lakes and enterprise data warehouses to data fabrics and data meshes, the architectural choices today can be overwhelming.


Join us (http://www.dbta.com/webinars/incorta/15sep2021/inc1)  to learn about the shortfalls of ""just rebuilding it"" in the cloud and how you can:
* Build a modern data architecture with a complete, end-to-end unified data analytics platform
* Move from ETL/ELT to data pipelines while leveraging open standards and file formats
* Go from raw data to reports in minutes no matter where your data resides with automated data transformation

Data architectures to support reporting, business intelligence, and analytics have evolved dramatically over the past 10 years. Instead of considering the data warehouse and the data lake as independent ""data islands"" that coexist in a cloud platform, it is time to reconsider the fundamental ways that information is accumulated, managed, and then provisioned to the different downstream data consumers.

Data analysis gets the lion’s share of the attention, and yet by some estimates data engineering comprises 80% to 90% of the work organizations do with data.

So why does the role of data engineer seem so, well, murky? The way we work with data is evolving quickly, and the job titles aren’t keeping pace. If you want a clear look at the role, responsibilities, skills, and best practices of data engineering, this report could prove pretty useful.

Data professionals are some of the most sought out individuals in the corporate world today. Any company armed with the right talent can derive more value from its data.

However, the marketplace can be confusing. The job requirements unclear, titles used interchangeably, and automation both accelerating and changing how tasks need to be approached.

That's why we've created the 2021 Data Practitioner Salary Report (https://get.knect365.com/ai-summit-london-data-practitioners-report/?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=kdnuggets&amp;utm_content=TAI2264&amp;tracker_id=TAI2264) ; allowing you to uncover salary information for the data and analytics market

GPU-Accelerate Your Data Science Workflows
Data science workflows have traditionally been slow and cumbersome, relying on CPUs to extract, transform, and load massive datasets, train DNNs until acceptable inferencing accuracy is achieved, and trained networks can be deployed. GPUs (https://kdnuggets.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=4f2891ebb155b23f120ece0bd&amp;id=fbf5f07aaf&amp;e=bfdfd73c17) substantially outperform CPUs and reduce infrastructure costs for end-to-end data science workflows using RAPIDS™, Apache Arrow, other open source software libraries, and all leading commercial AI frameworks, along with a vast array of resources provided by NGC. GPU-accelerated data science is available everywhere-on laptops or desktops, in the data center, at the edge, and in the cloud.

Read this eBook to explore the evolution of cloud data lakes from traditional data warehouses to data lakes and the separation of compute and data. Data has emerged as one of the key assets of every company and exists as its own separate tier within an organization's architecture.

In this eBook, you will learn:
bullet   How emerging open source projects like Apache Iceberg and Project Nessie are bringing transactions, data mutations, time travel and even a git-like experience to cloud data lakes on Amazon S3 and Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS).

bullet   How these open source innovations have resulted in data essentially becoming its own tier, enabling us to think about data architectures in a completely revolutionary way.

bullet   How this completely new, loosely coupled, open data architecture doesn't just separate the compute from the storage, but actually separates the compute from the data.

bullet   How your organization can achieve immense benefits from this new architectural design.

As hospitals cope with surges in COVID-19 cases, critical resources like ICU beds have become scarce. Data-driven strategies to coordinate care among different hospitals can lead to better utilization of available capacity, improved access to resources, reduced burden on hospitals and staff, and better patient care.


Join us for a webinar presented by Kimia Ghobadi, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Civil and Systems Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. She will discuss the mathematical models that her team developed, which match COVID-19 demand with available resources in a network of hospitals through patient transfer.


In this webinar you will learn:
* How system-level approaches to healthcare capacity can improve resilience against surges, ensure better use of available capacity, increase efficiency, and improve access and care for patients.
* How mathematical optimization can be used to determine optimal strategies to reduce the burden of COVID-19 on hospitals.
* How optimally coordinated patient transfers have the potential to significantly help hospitals cope with COVID-19 surges and balance uneven loads among hospitals.


The benefits of this approach will be demonstrated on a publicly available dashboard using real-world data.

How do you get a handle on your analytics data when all it does is grow? Do you build a data warehouse or a data lake? What if there were a third option, where the two architectures converged and offered you the best of both?

In its Q2 2021 Best Practices Report, TDWI surveyed 220 analytics and data professionals to outline a new direction in enterprise data architectures: the unified unified data warehouse/data lake (DW/DL).

Get this report to learn about unified DW/DLs:
* Use cases, terminology, data tools (like data pipelines), disciplines, and organizational strategies for unified DW/DLs

Hi there,

Nearly nine out of ten enterprise executives with revenue over $20 billion see AI as vital for the future of their businesses. In fact, even before the pandemic in 2019, companies were increasing their AI investments-in the amount of 4.6% on average over the previous year to about $38 million for each firm. Are you one of them?

In order for your enterprise to become AI-driven, you need to adopt an end-to-end AI solution that is a single ecosystem rather than separate tools that were never designed to work together.

Data teams are spending too much time bogged down by time-consuming queries and complex data systems.

Data lakes provide a cost-effective, centralized repository for both structured and unstructured data, yet despite these advantages, data lake users still experience challenges related to performance, managing data workflows and making data and analytics available to business users readily.

Join this session to learn how data teams can accelerate queries to data stored in AWS data lakes and storage, while reducing data engineering costs and simplifying data access for analysts and data scientists.


We'll review best practices when utilizing the power of Dremio and AWS:
bullet   The benefits of employing a data lake centric design

bullet   No data copies

bullet   Efficiencies created by separating storage and compute

bullet   How to stay open, flexible and portable

bullet   And more!

Data teams are spending too much time bogged down by time-consuming queries and complex data systems.

Data lakes provide a cost-effective, centralized repository for both structured and unstructured data, yet despite these advantages, data lake users still experience challenges related to performance, managing data workflows and making data and analytics available to business users readily.

Join this session to learn how data teams can accelerate queries to data stored in AWS data lakes and storage, while reducing data engineering costs and simplifying data access for analysts and data scientists.


We’ll review best practices when utilizing the power of Dremio and AWS:
bullet   The benefits of employing a data lake centric design

bullet   No data copies

bullet   Efficiencies created by separating storage and compute

Here's a common misperception about data analysis. You simply run statistical algorithms on high-performance data engines and voilà! Relevant, accurate, meaningful, and actionable data at your service, ready to fuel the proactive business decisions that help your organization scale.

Easy, right? Actually...

The reality is that analysts spend 80% of their time preparing data-cleaning, structuring, and enriching it-to get it where this kind of analysis is even possible. It's time-consuming, technically challenging, and complex.

A new eBook, Data Preparation for Dummies , simplifies it for you. It explains everything you need to know about data preparation, including:
* The main principles of data preparation
* The big shift from desktop or on-premise solutions to cloud-based data preparation platforms
* The democratization of data preparation so that everyone-not just data engineers or other technical staff with advanced coding skills-can do it

Data architectures to support reporting, business intelligence, and analytics have evolved dramatically over the past 10 years. Instead of considering the data warehouse and the data lake as independent ""data islands"" that coexist in a cloud platform, it is time to reconsider the fundamental ways that information is accumulated, managed, and then provisioned to the different downstream data consumers.

Download this TDWI Checklist report to understand:
bullet   How your organization can make this transition to a modernized data architecture

bullet   The decision making around this transition

Hi there,

According to VentureBeat, almost 90% of AI projects never make it into production. One of the biggest challenges is the inability to deliver an infrastructure that can both facilitate model deployment and support the production model lifecycle, including monitoring and governance. The discipline of creating and enabling this infrastructure is referred to as machine learning operations (MLOps).

Fortunately, over the past few years, a number of vendors delivering MLOps capabilities have entered the market, driven by the growing number of organizations trying to deliver value and ROI from their AI initiatives.

This Omdia Universe report (https://kdnuggets.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=4f2891ebb155b23f120ece0bd&amp;id=f8c56da717&amp;e=bfdfd73c17)  is a great way to set your bearings straight when it comes to selecting an MLOps vendor:

Exponentially Enhance the Operational Efficiencies in Your Company with the New Data Tier

Data is its own tier - consisting of multiple layers of open source technologies.





DOWNLOAD NOW (https://hello.dremio.com/ebook-the-new-data-tier.html?utm_medium=paid-media&amp;utm_source=kd-nuggets&amp;utm_term=2021-05-31-email&amp;utm_content=kd-nuggests-email&amp;utm_campaign=ebook-the-new-data-tier)





Over the years, data-driven companies have followed four primary principles to democratize data access: 1) Migration to the Cloud, 2) Scalability, 3) Flexibility &amp; Agility and 4) Availability.

These four principles have shaped the evolution of data analytics and data infrastructure: from the pre-2015 co-location of storage and compute in purely monolithic architectures, to the 2015-2020 separation of compute and storage in cloud data warehouses, and—finally—to today’s post-2020 separation of data and compute in data architectures.

Data now exists as its own, separate tier – built on open source standards and formats. The Data Tier brings data warehousing capabilities to the data lake and enables net-new capabilities that data warehouses cannot provide. It makes data highly accessible and flexible across multiple tools and engines and in general, makes data analytics and data architectures much more effective at meeting business requirements and providing business value, while at the same time being affordable, cost effective and operationally effective.

Read this eBook to learn:
bullet   How the modern data lake architecture consists of multiple layers of open source technologies that enable the data lake to provide data warehousing capabilities, as well as net-new capabilities DWs can’t provide.

bullet   How these open source technologies enable users to pick and choose the technology tools and engines best suited for the job, both today and tomorrow.

bullet   How industry standard open table formats (such as Iceberg) and open metastores (such as Nessie) provide an always-consistent view of data across different engines.

bullet   How the new data tier leverages open source technologies to bring synchronization and operational efficiency between the different tools and engines.

bullet   How new open metastores are leveraged to enable new functionalities that take advantage of the capabilities of the data lake architecture.

All types of enterprises use data lakes as a cost-effective, centralized repository to support a wide range of analytics use cases, from operational dashboards to data science, machine learning and even big data processing. Amazon Web Services (AWS) powers many of today's cloud data lakes, making them more scalable and simpler to deploy and manage-and making the data they house easier to manage and analyze. Despite these advantages, some AWS users still experience challenges related to data lake performance, data workflows and data access. But there are ways to overcome them.

Read this eBook to learn:
bullet   The top five best practices to help data lake architects realize an optimal data architecture

bullet   How to accelerate queries of data stored in an AWS data lake while reducing data engineering costs

bullet   How to simplify data access for analysts and data scientists

bullet   How to complement and extend the existing capabilities of an AWS data lake

AI-driven analysis has gone from esoteric to mission critical in just a few years. So what happens when you incorporate AI into your analytics portfolio? A lot. You’ll:
* Reduce analysis from days to minutes
* Help nontechnical users understand what to look for—and what to ask for—right from the start
* Find deeper actionable insights faster than is possible with static BI dashboards (and discover insights you didn’t even know to look for)

Open and straightforward: That's how analytics should work in today's Information Economy. But most architectures don't enable that vision at all. The business changes much faster than data engineers or IT can accommodate. Dashboards go stale, and reliance on them wanes. But the old way of doing things is suddenly changing, in dramatic fashion.
Register for this episode of The Briefing Room to hear 7wData Founder Yves Mulkers and Bloor Group CEO Eric Kavanagh extol the virtues of an open analytics architecture. They'll be joined by Scott Gay, Senior Architect at Dremio, who will explain how a semantically enabled, in-memory architecture revolutionizes the speed and efficiency of analytics.


Attendees will learn:
bullet   Why separating data from compute enables a pure data tier

bullet   How Apache Arrow tightly aligns in-memory query processing

bullet   The power of data ""reflections"" for optimizing performance

bullet   The value of leveraging inexpensive cloud storage (data lakes)

bullet   Why respect for data gravity will save you time, money and headaches

IT budgets are under pressure due to economic uncertainty, forcing technology leaders to find ways to accomplish more with less. With data and technology at the heart of the business, it is not possible to simply shut down cloud migrations and data analytics projects. Furthermore, in some verticals such as financial and health services, higher volatility and volume is leading to increasing amounts of data that needs to be processed and analyzed.

Read this whitepaper to learn how to:
bullet   compare the three popular architecture choices for cloud data analytics

bullet   reduce cloud infrastructure costs by &gt;75%

bullet   accelerate projects and productivity at a fraction of the cost of cloud data warehouses and simple query engines

Technical Director
Dremio



While BI dashboards are great at democratizing analytics in organizations, the architecture that traditionally powers them has hidden consequences that have serious impacts on the business.
This architecture is based on a 30-year old paradigm that requires many different systems, ETL jobs, and copies of data in data marts, data warehouses, and BI extracts. One downside of many is that it takes many days if not weeks to answer a different business question with this architecture. The negative consequences are further multiplied by the tens, hundreds, or even thousands of dashboards needed to run a data-driven organization
Now, there's a straightforward way to overcome these challenges that many organizations are already taking advantage of: an open cloud data lake architecture and Dremio.
Join Jason Hughes, Technical Director at Dremio, for this webinar to learn how you can migrate BI dashboards to Dremio to quickly provide interactive dashboards to data consumers without the issues of the traditional architecture - and finally deliver the benefits always promised by BI.


What You'll Learn
bullet   Why BI dashboards' traditional architecture implemented at scale causes many issues, which hinder the very insights it promises

bullet   How a Dremio-powered cloud data lake architecture eliminates or mitigates the negative consequences of the traditional approach

bullet   Step-by-step instructions for migrating a BI dashboard to run directly on a cloud data lake, both a self-contained example and your own dashboards

You're busy. We get that.


So, here's the TL;DR...


We here at Domino Data Lab wrote a children's book in hopes to introduce kids at a younger age to the magical world of data science. It's called  ""Florence The Data Scientist and Her Magical Bookmobile"" and you can download it, here (https://kdnuggets.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=4f2891ebb155b23f120ece0bd&amp;id=f2a0dd9b57&amp;e=bfdfd73c17) .


Now for the whole story...


So, we did something a bit bizarre for an MLOps software company. We wrote a children's book.


At first glance, we imagine that statement evokes in you what Jane Austen once upon a time dubbed a Quizzical Brow.


But, before you write us off, let us explain ourselves...


Kids want to be all sorts of things when they ""grow up"": astronauts, zookeepers, firefighters, presidents, etc. But, something you never hear come up is... data scientist.


Being that we're of the opinion that the knowledge, findings and abilities of data scientists can massively change the world for the better, we've decided it'd be worthwhile to introduce more kiddos to this particular field, earlier.


Because let's face it, while firefighting will forever be more mesmerizing to a seven-year-old than data
""Sciencing""... data science can put out many of the world's fires, too.


So, we've written and illustrated a book titled, ""Florence The Data Scientist and Her Magical Bookmobile"" (https://kdnuggets.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=4f2891ebb155b23f120ece0bd&amp;id=3dd8a9f668&amp;e=bfdfd73c17) , which you can download by hitting the magical glowing text to the left.

READ WHITEPAPER (https://hello.dremio.com/wp-the-unexpected-cost-of-data-copies.html?utm_medium=paid-media&amp;utm_source=kd-nuggets&amp;utm_term=2021-04-07-email&amp;utm_content=na&amp;utm_campaign=wp-the-unexpected-cost-of-data-copies)





An organization's data is copied for many reasons, namely ingesting datasets into data warehouses, creating performance-optimized copies and building BI extracts for analysis. Unfortunately, data replication, transformation and movement can result in longer time to insight, reduced efficiency, elevated costs, and increased security and compliance risk.

Fortunately, a next-gen data architecture enabled by the Dremio data lake service removes the need for replicated data, helping organizations to minimize complexity, boost efficiency and dramatically reduce costs.

Read this whitepaper to learn:
bullet   Why organizations frequently end up with unnecessary data copies

bullet   How replicated data increases costs and impacts the bottom line

bullet   How a next-gen data lake can halt data replication and streamline data management

bullet   What to consider when implementing a ""no-copy"" data strategy

bullet   How Dremio delivers clear business advantages in productivity, security and performance

Disconnected data copies are a key obstacle to democratizing data and making it readily available to data consumers. However, many organizations think of copies as a necessary evil - a requirement of the data warehouses, BI extracts, cubes and other constructs used to make datasets available to the analysts who rely on them while optimizing performance for their reporting and BI use cases. But what if there is a better way?

Join us to learn about next-generation cloud data lake architecture and how it brings together the best attributes of the data warehouse and the data lake to truly democratize data access.


During this webinar you'll learn:
bullet   How you can avoid loading data into a data warehouse by querying your data directly on S3 or ADLS

bullet   About using a semantic layer to provision different views of the data, eliminating the need for personalized data copies

bullet   Why you no longer need additional copies for performance optimization (e.g., aggregates or sorted tables)

bullet   How to achieve performance with a live connection from your BI tool, making BI extracts and imports unnecessary

bullet   About new technologies for high-throughput data exchange such as Apache Arrow Flight

Data science is too often discussed as a technical discipline, rather than a social and cultural one. But the role of data science is to both inform and automate decision-making processes, which require, in turn, humans to collaborate and communicate with each other and humans to collaborate with machines, both of which have key cultural and social dimensions.

This webinar, presented by Hugo Bowne-Anderson, Head of Data Science Evangelism and Marketing at Coiled, will answer key questions, including
* Why do so many executives feel that so little of the data work in their organizations actually deliver returns?
* How can we reduce friction in factoring the process of turning business questions into business answers through the intermediaries of data questions and data answers?
* What provisions need to be in place to make sure that everybody is speaking enough of the same data languages to excel at their jobs?
* How do we promote data literacy throughout organizations while getting the job done?

The Next-Generation Cloud Data Lake

An Open, No-Copy Data Architecture





READ WHITEPAPER (https://hello.dremio.com/wp-the-next-generation-cloud-data-lake.html?utm_medium=paid-media&amp;utm_source=kd-nuggets&amp;utm_term=2021-03-11-email&amp;utm_content=na&amp;utm_campaign=wp-the-next-generation-cloud-data-lake)





In an effort to be data driven, many organizations are looking to democratize data. However, they often struggle with increasingly larger data volumes, reverting back to bottlenecking data access to manage large numbers of data engineering requests and rising data warehousing costs. To address this, a next-gen cloud data lake architecture has emerged that brings together the best attributes of the data warehouse and the data lake. This new open data architecture is built to maximize data access with minimal data movement and no data copies.

Read this whitepaper to learn:
bullet   How this ""no data copy"" approach dramatically streamlines data workflows while reducing security and governance overhead

bullet   Why agile development concepts, when applied to the data tier, can dramatically increase data engineering agility

bullet   How to separate compute and data by preserving data in open file and table formats

bullet   About alternative solutions such as lake houses and how they compare to next-gen cloud data lakes

A few questions for you...
Does your team process high-volume or time-sensitive data that your organization depends on to deliver a product or service?
Do you have large archives of printed or scanned documents that need to be digitized and structured so the information they include can be accessed, searched, and maintained?
Do you have high volumes of incorrect, inaccurate, or inconsistent data that needs to be cleansed before it can be useful?
If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you should read CloudFactory's new Guide to Finding the Best Data Entry Services.
Learn about common use cases and industries where data entry services are fueling digital transformation, the pros and cons of several workforce and technology options, and tips for choosing a data entry service that can adapt and scale with your evolving needs.

Data scientists and analysts need fast access to millions of records. However, the throughput of traditional data transfer APIs such as pyodbc is insufficient to meet their needs, so they extract data into files on their local machines. This results in significant security and governance issues as well as stale data copies.

Join us as we explore how Apache Arrow Flight solves this problem by providing a new and modern standard for transporting large data between networked applications. We'll even run a live bake-off to demonstrate how Arrow Flight enables more than 10x faster transfer rates for highly parallel systems compared to pyodbc.

You will learn:
bullet   About Arrow Flight's remote procedure call (RPC) mechanism and how it fulfills Apache Arrow's promise of data interoperability

bullet   How you can quickly build data services with built-in authentication and security

bullet   How clients can connect to an Arrow Flight server endpoint using the Arrow Flight client libraries

bullet   About Flight SQL, an upcoming standard for data access that utilizes the tried-and-true SQL as its query language.

Why is my model failing? Why wasn't that cruddy data caught during QC? Why does our auto-labeling tool keep missing things?

If you've asked yourself any of these questions during the AI lifecycle, you might benefit from a human in the loop workforce strategy (https://kdnuggets.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=4f2891ebb155b23f120ece0bd&amp;id=bc9c8806c6&amp;e=bfdfd73c17) . From proof of concept through production, humans can do everything from inspecting, validating, and tweaking algorithms to collecting, labeling, and ensuring quality data feeds and refreshes the models.

Knowing when and where to leverage humans in the loop is key to reducing the number of failed AI projects and the time and money that is wasted on them. We've seen firsthand which human in the loop strategies worked for hundreds of AI clients and now we're sharing that insight with you.

In 2020 we experienced unprecedented market shifts that required data and analytics leaders to quickly adapt to the increasing velocity and scale of data. In 2021, many organizations will look beyond any short-term fixes to implement a modern data architecture that both accelerates and keeps costs under control.

Join us for this webinar as Tomer Shiran, Dremio CPO and co-founder, discusses the five major trends he predicts will emerge in the new year that will make modern cloud data lakes the center of gravity for data architectures.


You'll learn:
bullet   About a new architectural paradigm that fully leverages cloud infrastructure resources to put data at the center of the architecture

bullet   How emerging open source technologies such as Apache Iceberg and Project Nessie will enable data lakes to do what data warehouses do and much more

bullet   What security and governance trends will impact your data strategy

bullet   Why the increased need for cost control, security and data governance will result in a shift in power to centralized data teams

Modern Data Engineering with Azure Databricks
Hi there,
Every organization wants to build and extend the wealth of data accumulated in their data lake for deep analytics insights. However, most organizations struggle with how to make that data analytics-ready, and how to automate data pipelines to leverage new data as data lakes are constantly updated.
In this workshop, learn how you can leverage your data lake for powerful analytics insights. This workshop will give you the opportunity to:

* Learn how to build highly scalable and reliable data pipelines for analytics
* See how you can make your existing Azure Data Lake analytics-ready with open-source Delta Lake technology
* Integrate that data with services such as Azure Data Lake Storage, Azure Data Factory, Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure DevOps and Power BI as well as leveraging your Azure Active Directory security and roles without moving your data out of your account

Join us on December 8 for a launch event where you'll learn how the Lakehouse architecture delivers the best of both worlds - data warehouse performance with data lake economics - for SQL workloads. See how Delta Lake - the open standard for data reliability, quality and performance that simplifies data pipelines - now allows for traditional BI directly on your data lake.
This live launch event covers:

* A Keynote by CEO Ali Ghodsi introducing, explaining and diving into this new vision and the changing reality
* A live demo for an under-the-hood look at how the Lakehouse works and why it's so effective
* Partner talk with Tableau, Using Tableau to Analyze Your Data Lake
* Q&amp;A Conversation with Unilever and CEO Ali Ghosdi
* Additional technical breakout sessions
* Live Q&amp;A throughout the event

Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique with many uses across life sciences, financial services, marketing and more. Examples of practical applications include fraud detection, customer segmentation, document analysis - and yes, baseball.

Baseball, along with most other top-tier professional sports, has whole-heartedly embraced the promise of data analytics to gain an edge in areas such as scouting the competition, player evaluation and player development.

In this 30-minute webinar, Sig Mejdal (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sig_Mejdal) , VP and Assistant General Manager for the Baltimore Orioles, analyzes some of the best pitchers in baseball and demonstrates how clustering and data visualization techniques can be used to automatically detect hidden patterns in data.

Hint: It's more than just hiring data scientists


Hi there,
Listen in as our panel of experts discuss how machine learning products are not developed just by a team of data scientists. It's a team effort and you need the right team to work for AI to work.  It can impact speed, quality, and the scalability of AI programs.

In part three of this four-part roundtable series on Launching AI in the Real World (https://appen.com/webinars/launching-ai-in-the-real-world/?utm_source=Paid&amp;utm_medium=KDN) , we discuss the number one mistake companies make when kicking off their AI initiatives that nearly guarantees failure. It takes a whole organization to successfully bring AI into the core of a business.

Join us for a live panel discussion where we will cover:
* Why it isn't enough to just hire a bunch of data scientists
* Building the right culture and understanding what KPIs truly matter
* Real stories and ah-ha moments on the importance of cross functional teams

A Team Effort: Why Organizational StructureMatters More Than You Think for AI (https://visit.appen.com/Why_Org_Structure_Matters_Reg.html?utm_source=Paid&amp;utm_medium=KDN)

The stories of bias in AI are everywhere: Amazon's recruiting tool, Apple's credit card limits, Google's facial recognition, and dozens more. The quick solution is just to blame the algorithm and its designers. But it's not a question of whether or not you have bias in your institution, but rather how you plan to handle it.

We will explore the answers that question and many more in our webinar, How to Stop Worrying and Start Tackling AI Bias (https://www.datarobot.com/webinars/start-tackling-ai-bias/?utm_source=KDNuggets&amp;utm_medium=3rdPartyPromoter&amp;utm_campaign=WAIBIAS20-KDN) , where we will cover:

What can Data Scientists learn from the 2020 US Presidential Election? The outcome is still undecided, but it seems that the polls in several swing states have overestimated democratic vote, as they did in 2016. Precise prediction of human behavior is difficult, and small errors (eg 48% instead of 52%) that are acceptable in consumer analytics take on the outsize importance, when predicting election results in a swing state. Keep such possibilities in mind, examine prediction assumptions, and try to use different data sources to reduce error.

Will Ethics Kill the Predictive Analytics Star?
Governments worldwide are rushing to come up with ideas to regulate so-called Artificial Intelligence, automated and „autonomous“ systems, and predictive analytics applications. From the EU’s AI White Paper to the newly founded Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI), comprising 15 states (including the EU and the US), the question is how to deal with the powerful promises and high risks of optimisation technologies and probabilistic decision-support systems. Matthias Spielkamp, Executive Director at AlgorithmWatch.

Scaling Data to All Sides of E-Commerce Business - The Journey of Chrono24 to a Data-Driven Company
This talk will shed light on how Chrono24 became a more data driven company, from initiating the transformation over learning about data, to preparing our initiative for growth mode. At first there was a clear decision to become a data driven company from the C-Suite. Then we took some independent first steps to learn and made data one of our top priorities. This led to some very good insights and a lot of value in many cases, but also to dead ends in other cases. Dr. Tillmann Grupp, Director Data at Chrono24.

Innovation in AI is accelerating at a steep rate, and the tools and processes used to support such AI innovation are no exception. Data annotation is seeing advances, such as using AI and automation to pre-label data and conduct quality assurance, that seemingly promise to eliminate the need for human-powered labeling.
In this panel, experts from Azavea, Dataloop and CloudFactory discuss:
- The current and future state of humans-in-the-loop data annotation
- The importance of human judgment and subject matter expertise in annotating nuanced training data sets
- How technology will help us scale human annotation workforces

We're sorry we can't meet together to share information and ideas. It's disappointing to not be able to offer our in-person seminars and workshops, but we hope this will be the next-best thing.

Now available: a half-day on-demand workshop with Dick De Veaux, noted author, applied statistician, professor and data mining expert. He says that preparing your data for analysis is just as important as the analysis itself. Through a series of cross-industry case studies, De Veaux will demonstrate how to:
* Figure out which data is relevant.
* Identify trends that need further exploration with data visualization.
* Eliminate missing values before they become problematic.
* Sift through the extraneous information to pull only the most important variables into analysis.

While you have hired top-notch data scientists to build models and invested in data science tools, your AI projects still may not be getting off the ground. Research shows that the share of AI models deemed ""production worthy"" but never put into production is anywhere between 50 and 90%. Do you see yourself on that spectrum? So, what are leaders and teams actually missing? What can they do to finally gain value out of AI?

The last mile for AI initiative success is the deployment and management of models in production that require new practices, skills, and technologies. This emerging area is called Machine Learning Operations, or MLOps, also referred to as ModelOps by leading analyst firms.

MLOps solves precisely for this challenge by bridging the gap between data and IT Ops teams, providing the capabilities that both teams need to work together to deploy, monitor, manage, and govern machine learning models in production. In this webinar, we provide insights into what MLOps is and how any organization can adopt it to finally derive value from machine learning projects.

During this session (https://www.datarobot.com/webinar/last-mile-to-ai-roi/?utm_source=KDN&amp;utm_medium=3rdpartypromoter&amp;utm_campaign=WAIROI20KDN) , you will learn:
checkmark How to eliminate AI-related risks by adopting MLOps best practices
checkmark The inherent challenges of production model deployment and how to overcome them
checkmark Model monitoring best practices
checkmark What production lifecycle management is and why it matters

** A Primer on Data Drift &amp; Drift Detection Techniques
------------------------------------------------------------

Monitoring model performance drift is a crucial step in production machine learning (ML); however, in practice, it proves challenging for many reasons, one of which is the delay in retrieving the labels of new data. Without ground truth labels, drift detection techniques based on the model's accuracy are off the table.

In this Technical White Paper (https://pages.dataiku.com/data-drift-detection-techniques?utm_campaign=CONTENT%20Data%20Drift%20Technical%20WP%202020&amp;utm_source=emea-kdnuggets&amp;utm_medium=paid-email) you will:
* Take a brief but deep dive into the underlying definitions and logic behind drift.
* Explore a real-life use case presenting different scenarios that can cause models and data to drift.
* Delve into two techniques (the domain classifier and the black-box shift detector) used to assess whether dataset drift is occurring.

AI is becoming ubiquitous. More and more critical decisions are automated through machine learning models, determining the future of a business or making life-altering decisions for real people. With the rising stakes, AI systems must be built to be humble, just like humans. AI should know when it is not sure about the right answer to transfer the critical decision-making process back to people.

In this eBook (https://www.datarobot.com/resource/humility-in-ai/?utm_source=KDN&amp;utm_medium=3rdpartypromoter&amp;utm_campaign=20Humility-KDN) , we explore the concept of humility in AI systems and how it can be applied to existing solutions to ensure their trustworthiness, ethicality, and reliability in a fast-changing world.

Forrester's research uncovered a market in which Domino, Microsoft, Cloudera, Google, and MathWorks are Leaders. Seven other vendors were also included in The Forrester Waveâ„¢: Notebook-Based Predictive Analytics And Machine Learning, Q3 2020 (https://kdnuggets.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=4f2891ebb155b23f120ece0bd&amp;id=e470fc1ba0&amp;e=bfdfd73c17) .


Only one Leader is built by data scientists, for data scientists. And, according to Forrester ""tames the chaos, bringing all your different PAML tools together and binding them in a common, governed platform."" That Leader is Domino.


Arguably Domino invented the data science platform back in 2014 in order to make data science an integral part of how organizations operate all aspects of their business. Domino faced stiff competition in the Wave. Over 20% of the Fortune 100 leverage Domino as the data science management platform for their organizations. When you read the report (https://kdnuggets.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=4f2891ebb155b23f120ece0bd&amp;id=e984481f24&amp;e=bfdfd73c17) consider if you want the best in class data science management platform that was custom-built for data science vs the disparate tools from the cloud providers.


This crucial research is available to you for no cost, so you can pick the right platform for your data science needs. Key criteria evaluated included: modeling, collaboration, model evaluation, model ops, methods and algorithms, platform infrastructure as well as overall vendor strategy.

Annotating visual data is tedious work. But it has to be done well for ML models to work correctly.
What harm could a few incorrect pixels cause? Would you settle for potential misdiagnosis in hospitals or accidents in autonomous vehicles? You wouldn't. Your success and speed to market depends on the techniques, tools, and workforce behind your annotated images.
If image data is a big part of your AI project's dataset, you should read CloudFactory's guide to Image Annotation For Machine Learning (https://kdnuggets.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=4f2891ebb155b23f120ece0bd&amp;id=fd52dfad12&amp;e=bfdfd73c17) .
In this guide, you'll learn:
- The basics of image annotation for computer vision using supervised learning
- Techniques that are available for annotating visual data, including images and videos
- Considerations for selecting the right labeling workforce
- Key questions to ask a potential image annotation service provider

Dazu gehören unter anderem folgende Faktoren:
checkmark Menschliche Erkenntnisse und fundierte Erfahrungen sind erforderlich, um Anwendungsfälle je nach den spezifischen Bedürfnissen Ihres Unternehmens zu ermitteln. Zudem sind diese Faktoren für die Erstellung ethischer Bewertungen entscheidend.
checkmark Auch wenn Datenprofile teilweise automatisiert werden können, werden Datenwissenschaftler weiterhin benötigt, um Daten aus verschiedenen Quellen zu identifizieren, zu sortieren und zu vereinheitlichen und um sicherzustellen, dass alle Anpassungen der Datensätze für die Endbenutzer transparent sind.

Machine learning and Deep Learning are complex concepts, but you can learn them by ‘joining the dots’ back to your high school maths.

What do we mean by that?

Essentially, until age 17-18, you learn four components (at least partially) i.e.
* Probability Theory
* Statistics
* Linear Algebra and
* Optimization

These concepts are undoubtedly familiar to you if you have studied a maths/ science-based bachelors or engineering program. These four ideas also underpin machine learning and deep learning. Our work aims to bridge the gap between these high school maths concepts and data science (which is a collective term for machine learning and deep learning).

The course is created by Ajit Jaokar – who teaches AI at the University of Oxford and LSE. The course is not affiliated to any academic institution.

How did this approach originate?

I first developed these ideas when I taught my AI courses at the University of Oxford. As a teacher, I noticed that industry professionals often find it easier if I could co-relate complex ideas to simpler concepts. Especially if they already knew these concepts (even if they had learned them 10 or 20 years ago!). Hence, I spend a lot of time 'connecting the dots.' Note that this course is not related to any academic institute I am associated with.

Why is this approach unique?

Instead of AI, let’s talk instead of Elon Musk!

Elon Musk talks of first principles thinking.

That means you boil down a process to its fundamental parts and work backward through each building block to connect to the essential elements. This approach needs more in-depth thinking but provides for deeper learning.

In other words, first principles thinking is the act of identifying the fundamental parts that you know are true and building up from there. When applied in this context (learning AI), we can connect complex ideas to simple ones, especially to ideas you already know.

You may have tried to learn Machine learning and Deep Learning previously with limited success.

In my experience of teaching machine learning and deep learning, three problems inhibit effective learning. Often, these are missed by industry practitioners but are all too familiar to teachers - especially if they teach in class (face to face)
* Cognitive dependencies - ideas depend on other ideas that need to be explained first.
* Cognitive overload - there is too much information. Most of it is good. But you don’t know in which sequence to approach the topic.
* First-principles thinking – i.e., how things tie back to each other.

If these ideas resonate with you, you have come to the right place!

Details of Topics and modules

We have two categories of modules: AF modules (AI fundamentals modules) and MF modules (Maths foundations modules). In the AI Foundations modules, we first understand machine learning and deep learning in detail, assuming you have had no previous exposure to machine learning or deep learning. We then explore the ten maths foundations modules as below. In each case, we start with a concept you are likely to be already familiar with at the high school level (ex: the equation of a straight line) and then connect it to more complex machine learning or deep learning ideas.

You will cover the following modules: (note the order of modules could change)

Mathematics of machine learning: We start off with Linear algebra and the equation of a straight line. We relate it to perceptrons and multi-layer perceptrons.

Functions and mathematical modeling – In this module, we explore machine learning and deep learning as functions relating them to maths

Probability and inference: An exploration of probability theory and how it relates to inference

The maths of deep learning: An exploration of gradient descent and backpropagation from a maths perspective

Maths techniques used in feature engineering: Many maths techniques are used in feature engineering. In this section, we explore feature engineering and co-relate these ideas to maths.

Model evaluation: An analysis of model evaluation

A taxonomy of algorithms: We look at a technique to classify algorithms from a maths standpoint by considering the sample space or instance space

Unsupervised learning: Unsupervised techniques including generative methods

Bayesian approaches: In this module, we explore Bayesian approaches from a maths standpoint.

A recap of ideas: In this concluding module, we recap all the ideas we have learned.

A predictive model is only as good as the data used to build it. Many organizations are missing out on important opportunities to improve model performance because they're ignoring important data - namely text data.

By some estimates, more than 80% of the data generated in organizations is in the form of free text data - less than 1% of which is effectively analyzed.

In this 30-minute webinar, Ross Metusalem (https://www.jmp.com/en_us/bios/metusalem-ross.html?utm_source=kdnuggetseb&amp;utm_medium=advertisement&amp;utm_campaign=ts7013Z000002vWnOQAU) demonstrates how text data can be combined with non-text data to build better models and make better decisions. Register to watch Ross discuss:
* Examples from multiple industries of the potential value of augmenting models with text data.
* How to mine text data for important features and summarize those features numerically so that they can be incorporated as factors in models.
* A case study that compares model performance with and without the variables obtained through text mining.

Who should attend?

Anyone interested in learning how to mine information from text data and use that information as input into a predictive model to make the predictions of that model more accurate.

------------------------------------------------------------

Best practices for creating training data for ML projects

There's a saying: ""Garbage in, garbage out."" It's common knowledge that every machine learning solution needs a good algorithm powering it, but what gets far less press is what actually goes into these algorithms: the training data itself.

Your model is only as good as the data it's trained on.

Pulling from over 20 years of experience, we break down how to approach training data, starting with raw data and annotating and labeling it so that it can be used to power the most ambitious projects.

In the Essential Guide to Training Data (https://visit.appen.com/WC-2020-EssentialGuidetoTrainingData_RegLP.html?utm_source=Paid&amp;utm_medium=KDN) we cover everything you need to know about creating the training data necessary to drive successful machine learning projects, including:
* Why having a lot of big data isn't the same as having labeled data
* How to determine which labels to use to evaluate your success
* Where to find some great open datasets to bootstrap your model
