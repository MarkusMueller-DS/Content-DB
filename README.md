- I am Subscribed to the following newsletters:
    - KDnuggets
    - DeepLearning AI
    - PyCoder's Weekly
    - Data Elixir
    - DeepAI
    - ML Mastery

## Goal
- have one place where everything is saved so it is easier to search through it and find interesting stuff
- create a sql-Database which is automatically updated
