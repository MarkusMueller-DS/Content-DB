# Content Database
##### by Markus MÃ¼ller

## Problem
- I am following multiple newsletters, actively saving interesting articles to pocket or medium. Now I am at the point where I have no overview over all the articles and blog posts.
- Especially my mailbox is overflowing with possibly relevant information

## Goal
- have one place where everything is saved so it is easier to search through it and find interesting stuff
- create a sql-Database which is automatically updated 
- combine everything in one web app (Django)
