# Content Database
- by Markus MÃ¼ller

## Problem
- I am following multiple newsletters, actively saving interesting articles to pocket or medium. Now I am at the point where I have no overview over all the articles and blog posts.
- I follow a few terrific newsletters about Data Science, Machine Learning and programming but my mailbox is getting confusing and overcrowded with mails
- I am Subscribed to the following newsletters:
    - KDnuggets
    - DeepLearning AI
    - PyCoder's Weekly
    - Data Elixir
    - DeepAI
    - ML Mastery

## Goal
- have one place where everything is saved so it is easier to search through it and find interesting stuff
- create a sql-Database which is automatically updated 
- combine everything in one web app (Django)
